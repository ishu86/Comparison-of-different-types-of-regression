# Comparison-of-different-types-of-regression
We take a common dataset and apply different kinds of regressions(Linear, Multiple Linear, Polynomial linear, SVR) and observe the results.

This is a code in Python using the scikit-learn library for linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression (SVR) based on the provided dataset.We will predict the "Salary" based on the "Level."
